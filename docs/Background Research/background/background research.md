In this folder, keep atomic notes to inform your character design, level design, and so on. The strategy here is one idea per note. Let your notes develop organic connections: periodically, make linkages between them. 

You might want to designate some notes as 'summary' or 'map of content'; you could use transclusion (place a ! before a link and/or use ^ at the end of a link to designate a particular block of text in a note) to build up an overview.
